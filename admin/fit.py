"""Fit and campaign-role calls on a creator, and the suggestion for them.

A client reading a creator's analysis has to decide for themselves whether
the creator suits the campaign. The admin makes that call once, per creator in
a selection, with ready-made words: how well they fit, and the part they play
(awareness, engagement, conversion, UGC). `suggest` proposes both and shows
its working, so the admin confirms or changes it rather than starting from
nothing. It weighs, for the campaign's objective:

  - the creator's analysis of the platform, against the benchmark ranges in
    Settings (engagement by follower band, fake followers),
  - how much of the audience is in our market (KSA),
  - their reach,
  - and our own record with them: past campaigns, against what our creators
    usually deliver.

Nothing reaches a client until the admin saves, and every field stays editable.
